**what I'm currently working on:**
- I have started to make a wiki type of thing purely out of .md files and githubs linking features. You can find the current state of it [here](https://github.com/vilppes/accessibility-resources)

**history of currently learning so far:**
- github copilot (cancelled my subscription while on free trial due to fear of consequences later on)
