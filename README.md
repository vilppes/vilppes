Hello there, visitor! Welcome to my profile on github.com. I am currently trying to become a software developer and as a developer I would like to help people who cannot help themselves (people that are living with disabilities etc.) I usually (or whenever I can) spend my time studying new things about accessibility, because it is such an interesting topic to me personally.
