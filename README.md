Hello there, visitor! Welcome to my profile on github.com. I am currently trying to become a software developer and as a developer I would like to help people who cannot help themselves (people that are living with disabilities etc.) I usually (or whenever I can) spend my time studying new things about accessibility, because it is such an interesting topic to me personally.

**what I'm currently working on:**
- I have started to make a wiki type of thing purely out of .md files and githubs linking features. You can find the current state of it [here](https://github.com/vilppes/accessibility-resources)
- I'm working on a biggish system that I will describe in further detail in the docs of the respective projects that are parts of it. You can get the cloning commands for my main projects of interest [here](https://github.com/vilppes/clonethemainprojects)
